Our school is a wonderful, close, and on-site cooperation between WIX Primary School and the cole de WIX (Lyce Franais Charles de Gaulle). We value and cherish the rich mixture of cultures and world languages that are represented at WIX.', \"Based in vibrant Battersea in the borough of Wandsworth and right on the doorstep of the expansive sports areas of Clapham Common, WIX School sits just three miles from the heart of London, with all its world-class educational attractions. WIX classes make regular trips to among others: the National Gallery, the Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, the Science Museum, London Zoo, Kew Gardens and the British Museum. However, it's WIX's community spirit and its location in a quiet leafy residential street which gives it a village feel. Children have the opportunity to join community groups such as Beavers, Scouts and Guides, while local karate, judo, rugby, football, tennis, ballet, music and drama clubs all include WIX pupils.\", \"WIX School is packed with facilities to encourage the best of teaching, learning and fun. Active bodies lead to active minds and our school dining hall is committed to serving nutritional food, while our trim trail, enclosed courts with facilities for team sports including tennis, cricket and basketball, and outdoor playground with pirate galleon play area all promote healthy living. We also offer music, dancing, singing and performing during lunchtimes, as well as 'Bootcamp'. To keep in touch with nature, our children have the chance to be in the gardening area every lunchtime, learning about plants, growing foods to eat and taking care of the environment.\", \"As a st Century school, we also place great emphasis on the teaching of Information Technology/Computing. Our -computer IT suite includes a wide range of educational software and every classroom has an interactive whiteboard. Children have access to class sets of iPads, computing specialists and a range of computing and coding clubs. The IT suite, library and dedicated academic support rooms all enrich the school's learning experience and a school garden teaches pupils about growing plants and harvesting.\", 'We believe in the \"Making Each Day Extraordinary\" ethos and everything we do is underpinned by the following tenets of Every Child Matters: Be Healthy, Stay Safe, Enjoy and Achieve and Make a Positive Contribution. We teach in the categories outlined by The Cambridge Primary Review: The Individual Self, Others & the Wider World; Learning, Knowing & Doing.', 'All year round, we never stop monitoring our academic progress with regular assessments of staff and pupils. Our Headteacher and Deputy headteachers carry out constant performance reviews, leading Ofsted to say, \"(the school\\'s) capacity to sustain further improvement is fuelled by a fiercely ambitious senior team\". Regular visits from Ofsted, HMI, the LEA, the French Inspectorate and our dedicated Governors ensure our work is monitored and evaluated by outside sources.', 'Our internal School Improvement Plan identifies the areas we strive to elevate, which currently include raising performance levels further in Maths, English and the Core Subjects, improving writing in Key Stage  and continuing to provide extra support for our gifted and talented pupils and those identified as having SEN.', 'Since WIX School first opened its doors in , its fundamental aim has remained the same: to provide the best education possible to local children in a supportive and happy environment. Today, like a century ago, WIX gets its children from the local community, so the local area enriches WIX, and WIX enriches the local area. We believe that every child at WIX has the right to be taught equally whatever their gender, ethnicity, age, culture or religion. We are a fully maintained state school, with our admissions policy regulated by the London Borough of Wandsworth.', \"We are very proud of our school building, which because of its interesting design has been deemed to be of historical significance. The school has undergone many changes in its long history, as has the community it serves, but its ethos is unwavering; we provide a broad and balanced curriculum through which every child's potential can be developed.\", 'Uniquely we share our building with a French primary school, Ecole de WIX. This has given us the opportunity to develop language teaching at the school. From September , all children at WIX started to learn French. In addition, from September  we started a fully bilingual reception stream in which the children are taught half of their lessons in French and half in English, the first state school in England to do so.', 'Few primary schools in South London can boast the international recognition that WIX has achieved. Delegates from schools as far flung as the South Pacific have travelled here to see how we do it and the school has won a European award for languages. The French government made Marc Wolstencroft, our previous headteacher, a Knight of the Order of the Palmes Academiques for his outstanding contribution to learning and vision of developing the bilingual collaboration between two cultures and education systems. The current headteacher continues on from this work.', 'The WIX project is overseen by a group of highly committed Governors. Their role as \"critical friend\" means we never stop striving for success. Our enthusiastic and engaged Board of Governors is made up of professionals with wide-ranging backgrounds in law, finance, communications and science.', 'Ofsted described WIX as a \"truly harmonious community based on respect for each other at all levels of the school,\" where \"pupils learn to talk to each other to deepen their understanding of work\".', 'Our greatest accolades come in the words of the real experts, our children: \"WIX is a fun and joyful place to be.\" \"I feel safe in my classroom as I\\'m with all of my friends.\" \"You will always make friends at WIX Primary School\".', \"From trumpet lessons to football and theatre group to Arabic, there's an after-school club or activity to suit all children's interests at WIX. Extra-curricular groups meet after school and/or on Saturday mornings to offer a fully-rounded experience for the pupils.  Meanwhile in school, the Christmas Concert, Spring Hat Parade and End-of-Year Summer Show provide a focal point for creative expression.\", 'Additional opportunities are offered to allow children opportunities to expand their abilities within the context of the spiritual, moral, social and cultural framework of the school. Academic field trips, school exchanges and booster classes enrich and enliven the learning process.', 'WIX makes the most of the many world-class London attractions right on its doorstep with regular class outings to see everything from art at the Tate to chimps at the Zoo.', \"The varied extra-curricular offerings aren't just for pupils. Parents play a huge part in the WIX community, and create the school spirit by joining together as part of the PTA to organise school fairs, coffee mornings, parents' socials and even just a picnic on the Common.\", \"WIX is a historic, award-winning, progressive state primary school for children aged -. We provide children with the best education possible and strive for excellence. We know that every child is unique, with individual strengths and interests and we tailor our approach to each one. Above all, we welcome every child, regardless of their ability or background and commit ourselves to giving every one of them the best start in life. Our belief and drive is to 'Make Every day Extraordinary' for all.\", \"We strive to instil a love of learning for all our children. We do this by providing a rich, diverse and stimulating curriculum for children from Nursery through to Year  that widens their understanding of the world, gives them the literacy, maths and computing skills they need to engage with the curriculum and learning, and provides them with positive, memorable and thought-provoking opportunities. Everyone involved in the children's learning - teachers, leaders, support staff - works tirelessly to make sure that teaching and learning are the best that they can be, so that children move on to secondary school with a lifelong passion for learning.\", \"We value the rich mixture of cultures and world languages that are represented at WIX. While learning to speak both English and/or French fluently is at the core of everything we do, our multi-cultural environment is enriched by families who between them speak  additional languages. This is reflected in WIX's European Award for Languages. Creativity is highly valued at WIX with regular projects, activities and performances in well-known performance auditoriums around London (e.g. Cadogan Hall) of Art, Music and Drama. Meanwhile traditional core subjects such as Science, Maths and English are given equal focus. We have specialist Music, Sport and French provision. We also offer a fantastic computing syllabus and a range of computing and coding clubs. We also promote 'Cultural Diversity' weeks throughout the year.\", \"We believe: 'Everyone's Important - Ensure Inclusion's Outstanding'. So we work hard to ensure we are aware of any needs at any given time of ALL children in our school. All children are encouraged/supported to flourish at WIX. The curriculum is modified to support individual needs across all subjects; e.g. booster classes, access to visiting experts and coaches, holiday 'universities', specialist clubs, competitions and awards are just some of the ways we ensure our pupils realise their full potential. We provide extensive support for children with specific needs through Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) plans. If a pupil is identified through formal and informal assessment as having specific SEND needs, our SEND Coordinator works closely with teachers, parents and the pupil to draw up a targeted Individual Education Plan. WIX even works with SEND children before their arrival at the school.\"]\n",

      "['In Mathematics, we believe in the right to learn and the right to teach. All pupils are entitled to a safe and secure learning environment. Teachers have the right to be treated with respect and in turn give out respect that pupils deserve. Pupils are given the opportunity to work in pairs and groups where they learn to work with each other and understand how different people solve problems in various ways. Pupils are encouraged to respect the opinions and beliefs of others when discussing all mathematical concepts.', \"For example, Year  will complete a 'Famous Mathematicians' homework, whereby pupils research a famous mathematician and look into their background and beliefs, as well as their contributions to mathematics. When studying the topic of circles, pupils will have the opportunity to research the history of Pi. In Geometry and Measure, pupils also study Indian Rangoli Patterns, Pythagoras' Theorem and Fibonacci, all of which originate from different countries. Pupils are taught various methods of multiplication that stem from different cultures including: Russian, Egyptian, Chinese and English. Whichever topic they are studying, pupils will learn the origins of mathematics and they will appreciate that it comes from different cultures, thus understanding that mathematics knows no geographical boundaries.\", \"In Travel and Tourism, pupils develop their understanding of different cultures and societies by exploring different UK and worldwide destinations, as well as the importance of 'responsible tourism' in respecting others' cultures and opinions. The course promotes cultural values and traditions of other countries, as well as global citizenship.\", \"Pupils are also encouraged to work in groups and teams, learning to respect one another's contributions, opinions and different ways of doing things. This allows pupils to develop their ability to work well with others.\", 'In English, we strive to ensure that pupils always study relevant and topical non-fiction texts, exploring politics, conflict and different cultures. We encourage open discussion on the topics covered, often using these topical issues to inspire speaking and listening activities, such as: discussion, role plays and individual presentation tasks. We also study political speeches, exploring how political leaders promote their own ideology and how this can reinforce or challenge the hegemony of that particular society.', \"Through poetry and prose, pupils study different cultures and develop their understanding of the importance of tolerance - regardless of race, sexuality, gender, religion or culture. Texts such as 'Of Mice and Men' demonstrate the impact of discrimination on individuals and also allow us to explore contentious modern issues such as immigration. All pupils are encouraged to explore different viewpoints on issues and ideas, which directly ties in with the success criteria at KS and KS.\", 'Within the PE curriculum, pupils are encouraged to demonstrate a range of values that will enable them to become confident individuals, valued team players, and respected members of society. Pupils are expected to abide by the rules associated with specific sports and show respect to peers, opponents and officials.  Student opinions are always encouraged, listened to and respected.', 'Competition is encouraged in all areas of the curriculum, but not to the extent where fair-play and sportsmanship are compromised. Pupils are taught that personal sacrifice, hard work and cooperation are required when training and performing, but this does not always guarantee success. Acknowledging that you have been beaten by a better opponent and learning from mistakes are not signs of weakness, but an important step towards future success.', \"The Art & Design department at Unity City Academy is committed to serving its community.  It recognises the multi-cultural, multi faith and ever-changing nature of the United Kingdom.  This is reflected in the Art curriculum with an appreciation of the British arts and crafts through British history. British artist's designers and craftspeople are an essential part of our rich and balanced curriculum. It is our view that the creative subjects work hand in hand to develop sensitivity, understanding and tolerance towards others and offer pupils the opportunity to build upon existing skills through providing rewarding and challenging activities that inspire, inform, stimulate and entertain in a supportive and creative environment.\", 'The aim of the Art & Design team is to give students a passion for visual and creative arts that will hopefully last them a lifetime, giving them an appreciation of their countries achievements both nationally and worldwide. Our students are given a freedom to explore the arts in a safe and stimulating environment; where they know no matter what level or their ability they are all treated fairly and equally.', 'The study of History allows pupils to find their identity and understand their place in the world.  In History, we explore the relationship between differing cultures, classes and ethnic groups over time and see how they have evolved.   Pupils learn about the impact Britain has had on the world and what lessons can be learnt from the past.  Opportunities to reflect on attitudes and beliefs are wide ranging, notably in the History of the Slave Trade, Civil Rights movement in the USA, and the persecution of Jews in Germany.  Pupils are encouraged to express their views and provide reasoned arguments on such issues as the impact of the World War One, the use of vaccination, and human rights.', 'The study of History allows pupils to find their identity and understand their place in the world.  Pupils are encouraged to appreciate the legacy of British History for example through the study of Magna Carta, the building of castles and the achievements of the Industrial Revolution.   They learn the value of democracy by studying the changing roles of the monarch and parliament and the campaigns for the right to vote.  We hope to develop independent thinkers with a healthy sense of justice, who know what is right and wrong and can learn from mistakes in the past.  We aim to celebrate the achievements of Britain and foster affection for our cultural heritage.  Visits to historical sites, examination of sources, video footage and artefacts, as well as vibrant discussions in the class room, enable this to happen.', 'In a safe and supportive environment, we respectfully discuss and promote the fundamentals of: British values; democracy; the rule of law; individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.', \"PSHE concerns itself with the development of the 'self', the development of the individual, and furthering the individual's understanding of those issues concerning healthy citizenship in a culturally diverse society. Pupils are taught the value and reasons behind laws that govern and protect us, the responsibilities that this involves, and the consequences when laws are broken. We discuss and promote what it is to be tolerant, respectful, and appreciative of the traditions and values of our own culture, as well as that of others, and that it should not be the cause of prejudicial or discriminatory behaviors. Pupils also develop an understanding of the importance of identifying and combating discrimination. Pupils reflect and distinguish right from wrong and accept responsibility for their behaviour, discuss areas of initiative, and understand and reflect on how they can contribute positively to the lives of those living and working in the locality and to British society more widely.\", 'In Religious Education, many British values are studied explicitly as religious and non-religious concepts across the key stages. In our lessons, we aim to foster mutual respect through structured debate and discussion. Pupils are encouraged to question and explore sensitive and controversial issues, whilst maintaining tolerance and respect for the views and beliefs of others. Much of the Religious Education curriculum is focused on understanding the beliefs and world-views of different people all over the world, and through understanding, true tolerance develops.', \"Through group tasks and projects, pupils build confidence and develop their ability to work as part of a team. Being able to hold a debate, explain one's views and the views of others clearly, is key to building resilience of character and conviction. Pupils also develop practical values of self-esteem through these debates. At GCSE, pupils explore the moral agency and liberty of the individual and our responsibility as citizens is explored though ethical issues and theories. Pupils are encouraged to consider the philosophical religious foundations on which concepts of democracy and liberty are built. For example, at GCSE, the concept of the sanctity of life is studied and what it means for our treatment of other human beings.\", \"In Geography, pupils are encouraged to explore how places around the world have changed, considering how natural and human geography and processes that have shaped them. Pupils are helped to understand the complex ways in which communities and societies are linked and to appreciate the diversity of people's backgrounds.\", 'Pupils are helped to understand society better, appreciating diversity, and creating positive relationships with shared values. We promote tolerance and partnership, within local and wider communities. Pupils are encouraged to express well-balanced opinions, rooted in solid knowledge and understanding of current and contemporary issues in society and the environment.', 'The MFL department promotes British values through the curriculum and our teaching methods. Lessons often contain pair-work, group or team activities, which enable pupils to develop their ability to work well with others. The programme of study develops in pupils an awareness of the cultures of France and Spain and other countries where French and Spanish are spoken. In addition it develops inter-cultural understanding and fosters respect for diversity within our own community and world-wide.', \"This revision app boasts mostly free content and covers GCSE, A level, IB, iGCSE, Common Entrance and more. It works like this: you pick your subject and your exam board, then you take part in quizzes to test your knowledge. Not only do you get instant feedback, you're also given detailed explanations, so if you go wrong, you can work out why. At the end of a quiz you're told how many you got right, how long you took and you can review your errors. The app will also track your progress over time so you can identify your best and worst topics.\", 'Mindmaps, on paper rather than a computer, were what got me through my undergraduate exams. I created mindmaps for all the main topics, memorised them and then sketched them out quickly again in the exam and used them for all my essay questions. These days, I might well consider using an app like iMindMap or a web tool like bubbl.us so I could create and share them with friends easily, too. It works the same as it does on paper, but it is more mobile and, arguably, more collaborative.', 'Quizlet enables students to create their own revision flashcards, as well as to use sets created by others.

They also co-ordinate the work of the Academy Student Parliament and act as student ambassadors.  This has been a new initiative since September and has been very successful to date.  Their work is complimented by a team of Anti-bullying Ambassadors who are trained rigorously and regularly present assemblies tackling issues around bullying and understanding, tolerance and respect.  As an academy, we strive to achieve recognition as an organisation which deserves the acclaimed 'Anti-bullying Award'.

As a result, we are endeavouring to forge our own links with Universities in order to expose as many of our young people to further educational opportunities as possible.
