', u\"Our curriculum is structured in all years through a 'creative curriculum' or 'topic-based' approach.  This means that we select a main topic and teach all subjects in the context of that topic. \", u'We aim to select topics based upon the enthusiasms and interests of the children themselves and consult with the children to develop our curriculum.  Topics change every half term, except in Foundation class where they change more frequently to follow the needs and interests of individual children or groups.', u\"For example, in Year 6 many of the pupils were interested in Japanese 'Manga' style art. \", u\"We used this enthusiasm to develop a 'Japan' topic, using books with Japanese characters such as 'Kensuke's\\u200b Kingdom' by Michael Morpurgo and films such as Howl's Moving Castle as stimulus for Literacy work.  Artwork was inspired by the illustrations from the texts and the Japanese clothing at a Victoria and Albert Museum exhibit we visited.  We studied the history and geography of Japan, with a special focus on volcanoes.  All the planned learning was taken from the National Curriculum programmes of study.\", u'Throughout our curriculum, we focus on preparing our children for life in modern Britain and encourage an appreciation of its virtues. See our page on Fundamental British Values for more info.', u'Sample overviews and topics for Years 1-6 are listed below. ', u'Click on a link for more information on our exciting child-led curriculum.', u\"Every half term (5-7 weeks) teachers send parents a 'topic map' (click here for an example) and a letter detailing the planned learning for the topic, so that they can support their child's learning at home.

Many of these such as respect, tolerance and individual liberty are already explicitly referenced in our school values and at Soho Parish we regularly reinforce them in the following ways:', u'Democracy is an important part of our culture within the school. Pupils have the opportunity to have their voices heard through our Pupil Council as well as regular Pupil questionnaires. In addition, pupils get to nominate and vote on weekly class behaviour awards.', u'In 2015 we ran school-wide Elections, with 4 candidates from Y6 (representing the Progress, Tomorrow, Transform & Vision parties) contesting the vote. After a week of canvassing, manifesto-writing and a very lively hustings, everyone in school got to vote, with a 97% turnout.', u'The importance of Laws, whether they be those that govern the class, the school, or the country, are consistently reinforced throughout regular school days, as well as when dealing with behaviour. Children learn about our 8 school rules through school assemblies as well as in class and through our Soho Parish Rules Song; following the rules is encouraged through the awarding of house points and behaviour awards which always reference a rule.', u'Pupils are taught the value and reasons behind laws, that they govern and protect us, the responsibilities that this involves and the consequences when laws are broken. Visits from authorities such as the Fire Service, nurses etc. are regular parts of our calendar and help reinforce this message.  Specific curriculum topics further explore the importance of this value, for example this year our Year 6s undertook the study of the Magna Carta to celebrate its 800th anniversary.', u'Within school, pupils are actively encouraged to make choices, knowing that they are in a safe and supportive environment. As a school we educate and provide boundaries for young pupils to make choices safety, through of provision of a safe environment and empowering education.  Pupils are encouraged to know, understand and exercise their rights and personal freedoms and advise how to exercise these safely, for example through our E-Safety and PSHE lessons. Whether it be through choice of challenge, of how they record, of participation in our numerous extra-curricular clubs and opportunities, pupils are given the freedom to make choices.', u\"One of our school values is 'Respect' and pupils have been part of discussions and assemblies related to what this means and how it is shown. This is reiterated through our school rules, as well as our behaviour policy.\", u'Tolerance of those of Different Faiths and Beliefs', u' This is achieved through enhancing pupils understanding of their place in a culturally diverse society and by giving them opportunities to experience such diversity.', u'Assemblies and discussions involving prejudices and prejudice-based bullying have been followed and supported by learning in RE and PSHE as well as an Anti-Bullying week in October.', u\"We also celebrate diversity throughout our curriculum in various ways. We invite parents in to class to showcase their own culture (for example taking a Spanish lesson or playing Cuban music), participating in various religious celebrations such as Hannukah, Easter and Chinese New Year with community partners, and celebrating our families' multi-ethnic backgrounds through our International Evening.  In recognition of some of our significant language minorities, we offer a Chinese-language newsletter as well as English, Bengali and Chinese-language coffee mornings.\", u'Everything we do at Soho Parish is driven by our five values, which have been developed in consultation with children, staff, governors and parents. As an Anglican school, our values have their roots in the Christian faith and are outlined below.', u\"The Christian faith teaches that 'with God nothing is impossible' and Jesus encouraged his disciples to step out in faith and live 'life in all its fullness'. It was this belief which inspired members of St Anne's Church in 1699 to try and start a school for the 'poor children' of Soho so that they would have  the opportunity to have better futures than if they could not read or write. \", u'We believe that there are no limits to our potential.', u\"Writing in Psalm 139 King David wrote 'I thank you O God, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made'. David wasn't bragging - he just recognised that God makes all people to be awesome and capable of amazing things. \", u\"We listen to and value everyone's views. \", u'We treat everyone as we would like to be treated.', u\"Jesus said 'treat others as you would like them to treat you' it's the Golden Rule and is common to many world faiths. \", u'We recognise we are all unique with individual needs.', u\"Fundamental to the Jewish- Christian tradition is that though we are all different each one of us is'made in the image of God'- this means that everyone is precious, special and to be valued.\", u'We are a warm and welcoming community', u\"The Christian service of baptism recognises that we are all  'children of one Heavenly Father'. Jesus teaches us to think of others as our brothers and sisters and especially to welcome those who are different or unloved by others.\", u'Values such as respect also fit with our wider promotion of fundamental British values, which we do in a variety of ways such as learning about the rule of law and participating in democracy.

Our strong moral and spiritual ethos ensures pupils develop and prosper during their time at our school.', u'With only 140 boys admitted into each year group, Westminster City School is relatively small. This enables us to get to know our pupils as individuals quickly, teach in small groups and ensure every pupil enjoys coming to school and challenging themselves to be the best they can.', u\"The school's hardworking and committed staff deliver the curriculum in a way that ensures all our pupils are able to learn and achieve to the best of their ability. Our GCSE results are well above the national average with pupils achieving results that are in the top third nationally. Class sizes are often under 20 enabling those who need extra support in English and mathematics to receive it, sometimes on a one-to-one basis. Those who are able to take their exams early do so, giving them the best chance of obtaining the grades required for entry into top universities. Every decision we make at our Westminster School is focused on helping our pupils reach their maximum potential.\", u\"The school's Christian ethos and its promotion of cultural diversity permeate all aspects of the school community. Student behaviour is good in and out of lessons and they feel safe...\", u\"Our Westminster school has enjoyed one of its most successful years of GSCE examination results. 73% of our pupils have gained at least 5 GCSE grades A* - C including English & Maths. Overall the 2015 results were outstanding and a testament to all the hard work put in by the boys and staff. Fifteen boys achieved at least 8 A*/A grades.
